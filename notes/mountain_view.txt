Some reasons Mountain View is a good place for grad students to live:
- cheaper than Palo Alto
- there are many food options nearby on Castro St
- it has a Caltrain station
- it has a walmart so you can buy ramen relatively cheaply
- it is close to Stanford
- the city of Palo Alto just instituted rent control :)
