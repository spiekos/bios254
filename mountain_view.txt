Some reasons Mountain View is a good place for grad students to live:
- cheaper than Palo Alto
- there are many food options nearby on Castro St
- it has a Caltrain station
- it has a walmart so you can buy ramen relatively cheaply
- it is close to Stanford
- the city of Palo Alto just instituted rent control :)
- there are more things to do at mountain view at night
- I wouldn't have to deal with Stanford housing
- I would have a 30 minute commute at least
- It would be a pain to go into lab for minimal things on the weekend
